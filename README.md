# VPlay
VPlay is a sports court booking system which allows the user to book a court of their interested sport. You can see the working demonstration on by directing to the link: [Video_Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19-GXNJUq3TirnKhRbV_M4oE8U8DbFFZX/view?usp=sharing). It primarily has 2 functions, namely authentication and bookings.

_Authentication_
The website begins with a landing page that divides into 2 paths:
1. Sign up
2. Login
Each specifying different constraints and range of boundary values.

_Bookings_
This being a mini project behaves as a protocol with limited sports(5) and each having different number of courts.
